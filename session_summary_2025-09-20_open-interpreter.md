### Session Summary (2025-09-20): Open Interpreter Setup

**Goal:** Replace the non-functional HMP agent with a working, free, command-line AI assistant.

**Outcome:** Successfully installed and configured Open Interpreter to use the local `gemini-openai-proxy`, providing a stable and powerful assistant that uses the Gemini API. Also fixed several underlying issues in the user's environment.

**Key Steps & Fixes:**

1.  **Open Interpreter Installation:**
    *   **Problem:** `pip` could not find the `open-interpreter` package.
    *   **Investigation:** Ruled out network issues with `curl`. Discovered the root cause was an outdated system Python version (3.8), while the package required 3.10+.
    *   **Solution:** Installed Python 3.11 using the `deadsnakes` PPA.
    *   **Problem:** The `pip` installation for Python 3.11 was corrupted (`ImportError: cannot import name 'html5lib'`).
    *   **Solution:** Reinstalled `pip` for Python 3.11 using the official `get-pip.py` script.
    *   **Problem:** Installation failed again due to a `distutils` conflict with the system-installed `pyzmq` package.
    *   **Solution:** Successfully installed the package using `sudo python3.11 -m pip install --ignore-installed open-interpreter`.

2.  **Open Interpreter Configuration:**
    *   **Problem:** Running `interpreter` still prompted for an OpenAI key, and `interpreter --local` tried to download an unwanted model.
    *   **Investigation:** Determined that command-line flags did not permanently save the configuration. The `default.yaml` profile needed to be modified.
    *   **Solution:** Located the profile at `/home/igor/.config/open-interpreter/profiles/default.yaml`, created a corrected version pointing to the local proxy (`api_base: "http://localhost:8081/v1"`), and provided the user with the `cp` command to install it.

3.  **Proxy Debugging:**
    *   **Problem:** After configuration, Open Interpreter failed with a `Connection reset by peer` error.
    *   **Investigation:** `docker logs gemini` showed the application inside the container was listening on port `8000`, but the container was started with a port map of `8081:8080`.
    *   **Solution:** Restarted the `gemini-openai-proxy` container with the correct port mapping: `-p 8081:8000`.

4.  **.bashrc Fixes:**
    *   **Problem:** User reported a "command not found" error on shell startup.
    *   **Investigation:** Found a malformed, copy-pasted line (`\n# Add Fabric...`) in `.bashrc`.
    *   **Problem:** Identified a name collision where the `gemini` alias was overriding the `gemini()` function for managing the proxy.
    *   **Solution:** Created a final, clean `.bashrc` file (`bashrc.final.fixed`) that removed the bad line, removed the conflicting alias, and restored the correct `gemini()` function with the proper `8081:8000` port mapping.

**Final State:** The user has a working `interpreter` command that correctly uses the local Gemini proxy. The `.bashrc` file is clean and provides a working `gemini` function to manage the proxy container.
