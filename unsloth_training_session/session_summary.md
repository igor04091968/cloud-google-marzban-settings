# Session Summary (2025-09-19)

*   **Goal:** Train a local AI model on my knowledge base.
*   **Problem:** The user's laptop lacks the necessary GPU and RAM for local training.
*   **Solution:** Pivoted to using a free cloud GPU service (Kaggle) after discovering Google Colab was inaccessible.
*   **Current State:** 
    *   A comprehensive `training_data.txt` file has been created by consolidating numerous project files (`.md`, `.sh`, `.py`, etc.).
    *   A Python script, `kaggle_train.py`, has been created to run the training process on Kaggle using the `unsloth` library and a `gemma-2b-it` model.
    *   Both files have been saved to the user's local machine in `/home/igor/gemini_projects/unsloth_work/` and also copied into the `cloud-google-marzban-settings/unsloth_training_session/` directory for version control.
*   **Next Step:** When the session resumes, the next action is to provide the user with step-by-step instructions on how to use these files in a Kaggle Notebook to perform the training.
