# Session Summary: 2025-09-21 - SearchGPT Proxy Deployment

## Goal

Deploy the `searchgpt` application locally and bypass OpenAI's geoblocking by routing its traffic through a proxy hosted on a free platform.

## Key Learnings & Outcomes

### 1. Initial Problem: Geoblocking
- The `searchgpt` application, when run locally, failed with an `unsupported_country_region_territory` error from OpenAI.
- **Conclusion:** A proxy hosted in a supported country is required.

### 2. Platform Evaluation
- We researched free Docker hosting providers that do not require a credit card.
- **Candidates:** Hugging Face Spaces, Koyeb, Back4app, Render.
- **Render:** Eliminated due to the free service sleeping after 15 minutes.
- **Back4app:** Chosen by the user for the first attempt.
- **Koyeb:** Held as a backup. User initially reported it required a credit card.
- **Hugging Face Spaces:** My initial and final recommendation as the most reliable and straightforward option.

### 3. Back4app Deployment: A Series of Failures

This was a valuable, albeit lengthy, debugging session that revealed the limitations of the Back4app platform for this specific use case.

- **Success:** We successfully created a `Dockerfile` for a `tinyproxy` server.
- **Failure 1: Port Unreachable.** Our first deployment showed that ports opened in the container (80, 443) are **not accessible from the public internet**. Direct `curl` tests from the local machine resulted in `Connection timed out`.
- **User-Proposed Architecture (chisel):** The user proposed a complex but technically sound architecture involving a `chisel server` on `vds1` and a `chisel client` inside the Back4app container to tunnel the proxy connection out.
- **Implementation:**
    - **Success:** We successfully configured and ran a new `chisel server` on `vds1` on port `4443`.
    - **Success:** We created a `cf-ddns.sh` script to automatically update a Cloudflare DNS record (`prox1.iri1968.dpdns.org`) with the Back4app container's IP.
    - **Success:** We created a complex `entrypoint.sh` to manage `tinyproxy`, the DDNS script, and the `chisel client`.
    - **Failure 2 (Build):** The build initially failed because Alpine Linux does not have a `gunzip` package; the utility is part of `gzip`. This was fixed.
    - **Failure 3 (DDNS Script):** The DDNS script failed due to shell interpretation differences of `jq` commands in Alpine. This was fixed by rewriting the JSON generation with `printf`.
    - **Failure 4 (DDNS Script):** The script then failed because `bash` was not installed in the Alpine container. This was also fixed.
    - **Final Failure (Platform Limitation):** The final logs proved that the Back4app platform **ignores the `CMD` instruction in the `Dockerfile`**. It runs `tinyproxy` directly but never executes our `entrypoint.sh`. This makes running the `chisel client` and DDNS script impossible and renders the entire architecture non-functional on this platform.

### 4. Key Artifacts & State
- **Local Project:** `/home/igor/gemini_projects/iriproxy` contains the complete, working Docker setup for the `tinyproxy` + `chisel` + `DDNS` container.
- **GitHub Repo:** `https://github.com/igor04091968/my-prox.git` holds the source for the proxy container.
- **Local App:** The `searchgpt` application in `/home/igor/gemini_projects/searchgpt_project` is stopped. Its `docker-compose.yml` is configured to use the `vds1` tunnel, which is not active.

## Final Conclusion & Next Step

Back4app is unsuitable for this project due to its networking restrictions and its runtime behavior of ignoring the Docker `CMD`. The user has agreed to abandon this platform.

**The agreed-upon next step is to deploy the `iriproxy` project to Hugging Face Spaces.**
