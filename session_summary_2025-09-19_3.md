# Session Summary (2025-09-19, Part 3)

*   **Goal:** Download a pre-trained dataset from Kaggle for the HMP agent.
*   **Initial Confusion:** Restored context and incorrectly concluded the last project was Marzban. The user corrected this, clarifying the goal was to get data for the HMP agent.
*   **Problem:** The user provided a link to a Kaggle Notebook (`https://www.kaggle.com/code/fashionlisa/notebookfc8171e88a`). Initial attempts to access it failed (404, then empty content).
*   **Resolution/Current State:** The user revealed the correct way to get the data is by using the Kaggle CLI to download the *output* of the notebook.
*   **Next Step (for next session):** The user needs to run the command `kaggle kernels output fashionlisa/notebookfc8171e88a -p /home/igor/gemini_projects/kaggle_download` on their local machine. We will then inspect the downloaded files.
