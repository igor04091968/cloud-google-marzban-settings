# Session Summary - 2025-09-22

## Project
`my-prox` (npm version)

## Goal
Convert the `my-prox` project from `tinyproxy` to a Node.js-based forward proxy using the `proxy` npm package, and deploy it.

## Current Status
The project was successfully converted to Node.js and deployed to Back4app, but the container crashes on startup.

## Last Error
The runtime log shows a crash in `/app/server.js:4`.

```javascript
const server = createProxy(http.createServer()); // Error is here
```

## Next Step
The immediate next step is to find the correct usage example in the documentation for the `proxy` npm package (by author TooTallNate) and fix the initialization code in `server.js`.
