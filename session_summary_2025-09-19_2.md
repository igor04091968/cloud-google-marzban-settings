# Session Summary (2025-09-19, Part 2)

*   **Goal:** Continue with training a local AI model on the user's knowledge base.
*   **Previous Step:** All necessary files (`kaggle_train.py`, `training_data.txt`) were created and placed in `/home/igor/gemini_projects/unsloth_work/`.
*   **Action Taken:** Provided the user with detailed, step-by-step instructions for using the prepared files to train the model on the Kaggle platform. The instructions covered creating a notebook, uploading data, enabling the GPU, running the script, and downloading the resulting model.
*   **Current State:** The user has acknowledged the instructions and paused the session to download an additional file. I am now in a "frozen" state, awaiting the user's signal to continue.
