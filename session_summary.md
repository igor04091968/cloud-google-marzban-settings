# Session Summary: x-ui on Hugging Face with WARP Proxy

This document summarizes the debugging and deployment process for running `x-ui` in a Hugging Face Space with its traffic routed through Cloudflare WARP.

## Initial Architecture & Problems

- **Goal:** Run `x-ui` on Hugging Face, tunneled via `chisel` to a `vds1` server, with all `x-ui` traffic routed through WARP.
- **Problem 1: Chisel Instability:** The `chisel` tunnel between the Hugging Face container and the `vds1` server was unstable.
    - **Symptom:** `websocket: bad handshake` error.
        - **Fix:** Corrected the client connection URL to use `https://` without the explicit `:443` port.
    - **Symptom:** `server: Server cannot listen on R:8000` error.
        - **Investigation:** Discovered that stale/zombie `chisel` processes on `vds1` were not releasing the reverse port after client disconnections.
        - **Fix:** Created a `systemd` service (`chisel-server.service`) with an aggressive `--keepalive 5s` flag and `Restart=always`. Disabled and removed a conflicting, old `chisel.service`.
- **Problem 2: WARP Failure:** The `warp-cli` and `warp-svc` processes failed to start in the Hugging Face container.
    - **Symptom:** `command not found`, later `Permission denied`.
    - **Investigation:** Confirmed the architecture was `x86_64`. The `Permission denied` error indicated that `warp-svc` requires `NET_ADMIN` kernel capabilities.
    - **Conclusion:** The Hugging Face Spaces platform does not provide these elevated privileges for security reasons, making the standard WARP client impossible to run.
- **Problem 3: Local Interference:** A forgotten local test container was holding the `chisel` tunnel open, preventing the real Hugging Face client from connecting.
    - **Fix:** Stopped all local conflicting Docker containers.

## Final Working Architecture

A hybrid solution was implemented:

1.  **Hugging Face (`huggingface-x-ui-final` project):**
    - The container runs `x-ui` and a `chisel` client for access.
    - The standard `cloudflare-warp` package was **removed**.
    - It was replaced with **`sing-box`**, a userspace proxy tool.
    - A new `warp_proxy.sh` script was created, based on `Mon-ius/Docker-Warp-Socks`, which dynamically gets WARP WireGuard credentials and configures `sing-box` to run as a SOCKS5 proxy on port `1080`. This **does not require `NET_ADMIN`**.

2.  **VDS1 Server:**
    - Runs a robust `chisel-server` as a `systemd` service.
    - Nginx proxies `https://vds1.iri1968.dpdns.org/` to the `chisel` tunnel endpoint (port `8000`).

## Outcome

The system is now fully functional. The `x-ui` panel is accessible, and it can be configured to use the internal SOCKS5 proxy on `127.0.0.1:1080` to route its traffic through WARP.
