# Session Summary (2025-09-16)

*   **Goal:** Fix and test the `sync.sh` script for backing up and restoring `x-ui` configurations from a Docker container to a Git repository.
*   **Initial State:** The `sync.sh` script was incomplete and had several issues. The Docker container environment was not set up correctly for git operations.
*   **Key Actions:**
    1.  **`sync.sh` Enhancement:** Added `backup` and `restore` modes to the script.
    2.  **Dockerfile Fixes:**
        *   Installed `git` and `openssh-client` to enable git operations inside the container.
        *   Made `sync.sh` executable.
    3.  **`start.sh` (Entrypoint) Fixes:**
        *   Added logic to set up SSH keys for Hugging Face.
        *   Added logic to clone the git repository `git@hf.co:spaces/rachkovii68/x-ui` into `/tmp/repo`.
        *   Disabled strict host key checking for the `git clone` command to resolve connection issues.
    4.  **`warp_proxy.sh` Update:** Replaced the existing WARP script with a new one provided by the user that uses `sing-box` and does not require `NET_ADMIN` or `SYS_ADMIN` capabilities.
    5.  **Container Management:** Rebuilt the Docker image multiple times and restarted the container without privileged capabilities.
*   **Outcome:** The `sync.sh` script was successfully tested and is now fully functional. It can back up the `x-ui` database and configuration to the Hugging Face repository.
*   **Final State:** The modified files (`Dockerfile`, `start.sh`, `sync.sh`, `warp_proxy.sh`) are ready. The user was provided with the list of modified files.
