## Session Summary: X-UI and V2RayA Deployment via Chisel Tunnel

This session involved a comprehensive effort to deploy a robust X-UI and V2RayA setup, accessible via a Chisel tunnel through `vds1.iri1968.dpdns.org`. The process involved significant debugging and architectural adjustments to achieve a stable and functional system.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **New Robust Architecture:** Transitioned to a 3-container `docker-compose` setup:
    *   `v2raya`: Official `mzz2017/v2raya` image.
    *   `x-ui`: Official `enwaiax/x-ui` image.
    *   `chisel-client`: Official `jpillora/chisel` image.
    This architecture separates concerns and leverages well-maintained community images.

2.  **Stable Chisel Tunnel:** Successfully established a stable Chisel tunnel between the local Docker environment and `vds1.iri1968.dpdns.org`.
    *   The `chisel-client` now creates two reverse tunnels:
        *   `R:8000:x-ui:54321` for the `x-ui` panel.
        *   `R:8001:127.0.0.1:2017` for the `v2raya` panel (reachable via `host.docker.internal` from the `chisel-client` on the host network).

3.  **Configured Nginx on `vds1`:** The `nginx` server on `vds1` is correctly configured to:
    *   Proxy `https://vds1.iri1968.dpdns.org/` to the `x-ui` tunnel entrance (`127.0.0.1:8000`).
    *   Proxy `https://vds1.iri1968.dpdns.org/v2raya/` to the `v2raya` tunnel entrance (`127.0.0.1:8001`).
    *   Includes advanced headers for WebSocket support and HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection (`proxy_redirect`, `sub_filter`) to resolve browser mixed-content issues.

4.  **Resolved Numerous Issues:**
    *   Initial `Dockerfile` build failures (missing `package.json`, incorrect binary paths).
    *   Port conflicts on the host machine.
    *   `chisel` client/server version mismatch and `bad handshake` errors.
    *   `nginx` configuration conflicts on `vds1` (multiple `sites-available` files).
    *   `nginx` SSL key permission issues on `vds1`.
    *   `v2raya` panel access issues (mixed content, login/save failures).

5.  **Created Offline Build Package:** A `final_offline_build` directory has been created, containing:
    *   `Dockerfile`: For building the `x-ui` container from local sources.
    *   `entrypoint.sh`: The final working entrypoint script.
    *   `sources.md`: A manifest of all downloaded component URLs.
    *   `sources/`: All downloaded binary archives.

### Access Details:

*   **x-ui Panel:** `https://vds1.iri1968.dpdns.org/`
*   **v2raya Panel:** `https://vds1.iri1968.dpdns.org/v2raya/`

### Next Steps:

*   The system is now fully operational and ready for use. The user can proceed with configuring `x-ui` and `v2raya` through their respective web panels.
