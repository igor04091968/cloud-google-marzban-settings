# Session Summary (2025-09-19, Part 5)

## Goal: Restore 5 Key Docker Containers

This session focused on restoring the user's primary Docker environment after a data migration to a USB hard drive.

### Key Accomplishments & Discoveries:

1.  **Context Restoration:** Successfully restored context after initial confusion by prioritizing user input and local system state over potentially outdated git logs.
2.  **Docker `btrfs` Issue:** Diagnosed and fixed a critical Docker build error (`failed to register layer: file exists`).
    *   **Diagnosis:** Identified that the USB drive uses the `btrfs` filesystem, which conflicted with Docker's default `overlay2` storage driver.
    *   **Solution:** Successfully modified `/etc/docker/daemon.json` to force Docker to use the correct `btrfs` storage driver. This was a key fix for the environment.
3.  **Container Restoration Progress (2/5 Complete):**
    *   **`gemini-openai-proxy`:** **RESTORED**. Running as container `gemini` on host port `8081`.
    *   **`hmp_agent`:** **RESTORED**. The `hmp-agent:local` image was successfully built after fixing the storage driver, and the container is running as `hmp_agent` on port `8765`.

### Current State & Next Steps:

*   **In Progress (Container 3/5):** We were about to restore the **`unsloth`** container.
*   **Identified Command:** The correct command was identified and confirmed:
    ```bash
    sudo docker run --gpus all --restart=unless-stopped -d -p 8888:8888 --name unsloth -v /home/igor/gemini_projects/unsloth_work:/workspace unsloth/unsloth:latest
    ```
*   **Next Action:** The next action upon resuming will be to execute the command above to start the `unsloth` container.
*   **Pending Containers (4 & 5):** `AnythingLLM` and `Marzban`.
