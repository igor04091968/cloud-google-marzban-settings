# Session Summary (2025-09-19, Part 4)

*   **Goal:** Set up a `chisel` server on the user's laptop to allow SSH access from a Cloud Shell client.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Started a `chisel server` locally on port `993` with the parameters `--reverse --auth "notebook:2025"`.
    *   Attempted to connect via SSH through the established tunnel (`ssh -p 2222 frad84435@localhost`).
    *   The connection failed with a `Permission denied (publickey)` error.
*   **Current State:** I have instructed the user on how to copy their public SSH key from `/home/igor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and add it to the `authorized_keys` file on the Cloud Shell machine for the `frad84435` user.
*   **Next Step:** Waiting for the user to confirm they have added the public key, at which point I will re-attempt the SSH connection.
