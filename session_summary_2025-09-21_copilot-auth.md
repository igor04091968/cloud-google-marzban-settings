# Session Summary: 2025-09-21 - GitHub Copilot CLI Auth Issue

## Goal
The user reported that the `copilot` alias was not working and requested a fix.

## Diagnosis
1.  The `copilot` alias was found in `~/.bashrc` and is correctly defined as `alias copilot='ghcs'`.
2.  The `ghcs` function is a wrapper for the `gh copilot suggest` command.
3.  The GitHub CLI (`gh`) and the `copilot` extension are both correctly installed.
4.  Direct execution of `gh copilot suggest "list files"` revealed the root cause: **`Error: No valid GitHub CLI OAuth token detected`**.
5.  Investigation of the configuration file at `/home/igor/.config/gh/hosts.yml` confirmed that it contains user information but is missing the necessary `oauth_token`.

## Resolution
The issue can only be resolved by user intervention.

**Required Action (by user):** The user must run the following command in their terminal and complete the web-based authentication flow:
```bash
gh auth login --web -h github.com
```

## Status
**Pending User Action.** The problem has been fully diagnosed, and the solution has been provided to the user. The `copilot` alias will remain non-functional until the authentication step is completed.
