# Session Summary: 2025-09-24

## Goal
Successfully deploy the `xray-vps-setup` (Marzban) project on the `vds1.iri1968.dpdns.org` server using Docker Compose.

## Problem
The `marzban` Docker container starts successfully (`docker ps` shows it as 'Up'), but the core `xray` service within it fails to run and bind to the public port 443. This is confirmed by `ss -tlpn | grep :443` returning empty. The container logs (`docker logs marzban`) are also consistently empty, indicating a silent crash early in the process.

## Troubleshooting Steps & Outcomes

1.  **Hypothesis: Invalid `xray_config.json` due to complex routing rules.**
    *   **Action:** We tried simplifying the `xray_config.json` by removing a complex WARP routing rule.
    *   **Outcome:** No change. The service still failed to bind to port 443.

2.  **Hypothesis: Incorrect TLS configuration.**
    *   **Action:** We attempted to configure `xray` to use the system's Let's Encrypt certificates by modifying `xray_config.json` and mounting `/etc/letsencrypt` in `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   **Outcome:** No change. The service still failed.

3.  **Hypothesis: Deviation from the original script's logic.**
    *   **Action:** We reverted both `xray_config.json` and `docker-compose.yml` to their original states as generated by the author's script (using VLESS + Reality, without mounting external certificates).
    *   **Outcome:** Failure. Even with the pristine, intended configuration, `xray` did not start.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

The problem is not with the configuration files (`xray_config.json`, `docker-compose.yml`) themselves, as even the original, known-good configuration fails. The silent failure of `xray` suggests an issue with the execution environment inside the container or a fundamental incompatibility.

**The next logical step is to get a direct error message from the `xray` binary.**

**Recommended Action on Resume:**
1.  SSH into `vds1.iri1968.dpdns.org`.
2.  Execute the following command to run `xray` manually inside the running `marzban` container and observe the output directly:
    ```bash
    docker exec marzban xray -c /code/xray_config.json
    ```
This will bypass the container's entrypoint script and should print the fatal error to the console, revealing the root cause of the failure.
